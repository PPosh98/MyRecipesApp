# ðŸ¥˜ Recipes App

This is a simple recipes app that was developed using Jetpack Compose on an MVVM architecture. It enables you to search up a recipe and have its details displayed such as
the ingredients, cooking time, instructions etc. If there is a particular recipe that you really like, you can add it to your favourites for viewing later, however, this feature is only offered on the paid version of the app.
