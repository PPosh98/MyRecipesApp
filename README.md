# MyRecipesApp

This is a simple recipes app that was developed using Jetpack Compose on an MVVM architecture. It enables you to search up a recipe and have its details displayed such as
the ingredients, cooking time, instructions etc. If there is a particular recipe that you really like, you can add it to your favourites for safe keeping.
